# Video Search Desktop Application - Complete Project Plan

## Project Overview
A cross-platform desktop application that enables users to search their personal video files by spoken content using local AI transcription, working completely offline.

## Current Status
**Phase**: Mid Phase 1 - Basic Structure Complete, Phase 2 Partially Implemented
**Status**: Core foundation established, but several key features are mocked or incomplete

### ✅ Completed Features
- [x] Basic Electron app structure with TypeScript
- [x] Hybrid build system (TypeScript for main process, Webpack for renderer)
- [x] Folder selection dialog functionality
- [x] Video file scanning and detection (.mp4, .mkv, .avi, .mov, .webm, .m4v, .wmv, .flv)
- [x] Basic React UI with video listing
- [x] IPC communication between main and renderer processes
- [x] Video metadata display (file name, size, path)
- [x] Video library grid view with status indicators

### 🔄 Partially Implemented Features
- [🔄] **SQLite Database**: Implemented with full fallback to memory-only mode
  - ✅ Database schema and structure complete
  - ✅ All CRUD operations implemented
  - ❌ **Critical Issue**: Database likely fails to initialize in most cases, falls back to memory
  - ❌ **Missing**: Proper error handling and database validation
- [🔄] **Video Metadata Storage**: 
  - ✅ Data structure and storage methods implemented
  - ❌ **Critical Issue**: Since database fails, videos are only stored in memory (lost on restart)
- [🔄] **Search Functionality**:
  - ✅ UI search bar and results display implemented
  - ✅ FTS5 search query structure implemented
  - ❌ **Critical Issue**: No actual transcripts to search (only mock data)
  - ❌ **Missing**: Real search results (will always return empty)

### ❌ Mock/Missing Features (Not Actually Implemented)
- [❌] **Transcription System**: Completely mocked
  - Mock generates 3 hardcoded dummy transcript segments
  - No actual audio extraction or AI transcription
  - No integration with Whisper or any transcription service
- [❌] **Persistent Data Storage**: Database falls back to memory-only mode
  - Videos are lost when app restarts
  - No actual SQLite database file created/used
- [❌] **Real Search Results**: Search will always return empty results
  - No real transcript data to search through
  - FTS5 search infrastructure exists but has no data

### 🔧 Build Architecture Resolution
**Issue Resolved**: Fixed critical module resolution problem that was preventing proper application builds.

**Problem**: Initial webpack configuration was attempting to bundle the Electron main process like a web application, which caused:
- Module imports to break at runtime
- Native modules (like better-sqlite3) to fail
- File system operations to become unreliable
- Over-bundling of Node.js modules into a single minified file

**Solution Implemented**: Hybrid build approach
- **Main Process**: Uses TypeScript compiler (`tsc`) to preserve module structure
- **Renderer Process**: Uses webpack for proper web-like bundling
- **Preload Script**: Compiled with TypeScript maintaining proper module resolution

**Why This Approach is Superior**:
1. **Node.js Compatibility**: Main process modules remain as separate files, allowing proper Node.js module resolution
2. **Native Module Support**: Better-sqlite3 and other native modules work correctly
3. **Dynamic Imports**: File system operations and dynamic requires function properly
4. **Debugging**: Readable, non-minified code in the main process for easier debugging
5. **Module Structure**: Preserves the intended architecture with separate IPC, database, and video processing modules

**Build Configuration**:
```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "build": "npm run build:main && npm run build:renderer",
    "build:main": "tsc -p tsconfig.main.json",
    "build:renderer": "webpack --mode production"
  }
}
```

## Tech Stack

- **Issue**: SQLite database fails to initialize, app falls back to memory-only mode
- **Impact**: Videos are lost on restart, search doesn't work
- **Tasks**:
  - Debug better-sqlite3 initialization issues
  - Add proper error logging for database failures
  - Test database functionality across platforms
  - Ensure database file is created and accessible

### 2. Implement Real Transcription (CRITICAL - Phase 3)
- **Priority**: HIGH
- **Issue**: Transcription is completely mocked with hardcoded data
- **Impact**: Search functionality is non-functional
- **Tasks**:
  - Research and implement FFmpeg integration for audio extraction
  - Set up Whisper integration (recommend whisper.cpp for better performance)
  - Replace mock transcription system with real implementation
  - Test transcription pipeline end-to-end

### 3. Complete Video File Management (Phase 2)
- **Priority**: MEDIUM
- **Issue**: Video metadata not persisted, limited metadata extraction
- **Tasks**:
  - Fix persistent video storage (depends on database fix)
  - Extract actual video metadata (duration, resolution)
  - Improve error handling for corrupted video files
  - Add video thumbnail generation (optional)

### 4. Code Quality Improvements
- **Priority**: MEDIUM
- **Tasks**:
  - Add proper error handling and logging throughout
  - Implement proper TypeScript strict mode compliance
  - Add JSDoc comments for better documentation
  - Refactor inline types in preload.ts (consider moving back to shared types)

## Technical Considerations

### Build Architecture (Critical)
- **Main Process**: Always use TypeScript compiler, never webpack
- **Renderer Process**: Use webpack for proper web bundling
- **Preload Scripts**: Use TypeScript compiler with proper module resolution
- **Native Modules**: Ensure they remain unbundled and properly linked

### Database Issues (Critical)
- **Current Problem**: better-sqlite3 likely failing to initialize
- **Investigation Needed**: Check native module compilation, platform compatibility
- **Fallback Strategy**: Memory-only mode works but data is not persistent
- **Solution Required**: Proper database initialization and error handling

### Performance
- Use worker threads for transcription to avoid blocking UI
- Implement database connection pooling
- Cache frequently accessed data
- Optimize video file scanning with async operations

### Security
- Validate all file paths to prevent directory traversal
- Sanitize database inputs
- Handle malformed video files gracefully

### Cross-Platform Compatibility
- Use path.join() for file paths
- Test on Windows, macOS, and Linux
- Handle platform-specific video codecs

## Success Metrics
- Application starts in <3 seconds ✅ (Currently achieved)
- Video scanning completes in <1 second per 100 files ✅ (Currently achieved)
- Database initialization succeeds ❌ (Currently failing)
- Videos persist between sessions ❌ (Currently failing)
- Transcription processes at >1x real-time speed ❌ (Not implemented)
- Search returns actual results ❌ (Currently returns empty)
- Memory usage stays <500MB for 1000 videos ❌ (To be tested after database fix)
- Cross-platform compatibility verified ❌ (To be tested)

## Risk Mitigation
- **Build Architecture**: ✅ Resolved - Proper TypeScript/Webpack hybrid approach implemented
- **Database Issues**: ❌ **CRITICAL RISK** - Database initialization failing, requires immediate attention
- **Mock Transcription**: ❌ **HIGH RISK** - Core functionality not implemented, app appears functional but isn't
- **Whisper Integration**: Have fallback to cloud API if local fails
- **FFmpeg Issues**: Include pre-built binaries for all platforms
- **Database Performance**: ✅ Proper indexing implemented (when database works)
- **Large Files**: Set reasonable file size limits and warnings
- **Cross-Platform**: Test early and often on all target platforms

## Lessons Learned
1. **Electron Build Architecture**: Never bundle the main process with webpack - use TypeScript compiler to preserve Node.js module structure
2. **Database Reliability**: Need robust error handling and fallback strategies for native modules
3. **Mock vs Real Implementation**: Clear distinction needed between working UI and functional backend
4. **Phase Assessment**: Regular codebase analysis needed to ensure accurate progress tracking
5. **Critical Dependencies**: Native modules like better-sqlite3 require careful testing and error handling

## Assessment
The application currently presents a **functional-looking interface** but has **critical backend issues**:

1. **Database Failure**: Most core functionality depends on SQLite, which is currently failing
2. **Mock Transcription**: The primary feature (video transcription) is completely mocked
3. **Non-Persistent Data**: Videos are lost when the app restarts
4. **Non-Functional Search**: Search UI works but will always return empty results
